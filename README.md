## Object Measurement Application

This project is a computer vision-based application designed to measure the dimensions of objects using a camera. The user places a rectangular object on a sheet of paper, and the application detects its contours and displays its length and width in real-time.

Key features:

- Detects the edges of objects and the reference sheet (A4, A5, or A3).
- Uses OpenCV for image processing and measurement calculations.
- Provides real-time visual feedback with measurement annotations.

The application is implemented in Python and utilizes OpenCV, NumPy, and Tkinter for image processing and the graphical interface.
